A c++ library which aims at massive point cloud data processing, involves smart pointer and smart array, mathematical structures and operations（vector, matrix, quaternion, transform etc）, computational geometry(point, line, plane, polygon, rect, box, convex hull etc), indices (grid, kd-tree, octree, r-tree) and clusters (distance cluster, DBScan cluster, mean-shift cluster) etc.
